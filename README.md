Assignment
Please note that it would be preferable to avoid relying on built-in methods such as collections, shuffle
in Java, or arrow functions of JavaScript. Instead, creating a method or function from scratch and using
your own logic in the assignment would be worth considering.

C. Check if the input is pangram or not. (Pangram is a sentence that contains all the alphabet
from a-z)

Gender (checkbox), Profession, email, and mobile number. All the input fields are
necessary to submit the form. Create two buttons Submit and Reset. Reset will reset the
